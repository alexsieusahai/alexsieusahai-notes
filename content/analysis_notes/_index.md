# Notes on Analysis

A series of basic results in a first year undergraduate analysis course, along with some exercises I thought were good. Very close in structure and presentation with Understanding Analysis by Abbott, and Introduction to Real Analysis by Lebl. I highly recommend doing the exercises in both books, as that's where a lot of the real learning happens.
