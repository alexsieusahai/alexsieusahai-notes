# Set Theory

I will assume you know what a set is, and what the operations \\( A \cup B, A \cap B, A / B \\) do.

Two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are _disjoint_ if \\( A \cap B = \emptyset.\\) \\

We will take _DeMorgan's Law_ for granted, as I think the proof does not contribute anything to our goal of understanding analysis better:
$$ A / (B \cup C) = (A / B) \cap (A / C) $$
$$ A / (B \cap C) = (A / B) \cup (A / C) $$
