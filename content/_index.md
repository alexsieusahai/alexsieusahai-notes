# Alex Sieusahai's Notes
Use the navigation bar to get to my notes on various things. \\
Right now I am aiming to partially complete a guide / solution manual for _Understanding Analysis_ by Stephen Abbott. \\
My Github is [here](https://github.com/alexsieusahai), and my Kaggle is [here](https://kaggle.com/alexsieusahai). \\
Currently looking for research opportunities in machine learning or deep learning, and I am open to new internship opportunities. Please contact me at _asieusah@ualberta.ca_.
